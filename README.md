# Octree.gd
Simple GDScript Octree implementation for Godot(4.*)

 - [octree.gd](octree.gd)
 - [searcher.gd](searcher.gd)
 - Current implementation depends on [ThreadQueue.gd](https://github.com/daniel-mcclintock/ThreadQueue.gd) for searcher.gd
 - Decent enough performance for a GDScript implementation(1,000,000 point test, ~10ms to ~50ms depending on depth)
